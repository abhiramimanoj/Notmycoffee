order coffee, make ur customisation just to end up with something u never asked for. useless, innit?
This project was born during a caffeine-fueled hackathon sprint.  
Built with **Next.js**, styled with a generous sprinkle of AI magic, and deployed on **Vercel**.  

## Problem:
Coffee lovers know exactly what they want — strength, sweetness, milk type, temperature — yet life often has other plans. Orders get mixed up, baristas improvise, and sometimes… you get something wildly different from what you asked for.
## Solution:
A coffee customisation webpage that embraces the chaos.
You pick your perfect coffee, we absolutely guarantee to serve you something entirely different.
It’s unpredictable, it’s useless, and it’s a perfect reminder to never take your brew too seriously.

## 💡 What it does
- Displays a sleek UI for a coffee brewing concept app.
- Icons and layout generated with AI assistance.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) — instant deployments, instant relief.
- AI layout generation (via Orchid)
